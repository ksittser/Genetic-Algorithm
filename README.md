# Genetic-Algorithm
Messing around with genetic algorithms

Simple experiment that starts with hundreds of "dots" at the top corner of the screen which learn how to navigate a series of walls to reach the bottom corner via genetic algorithm.

Runs with `g++ genetic_algorithm_new.cpp -std=c++11` and then `./a.out`
